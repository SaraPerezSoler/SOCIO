{+Hello. My name is Socio and I am here to help you. I give you some tips to work with me: 
	1. Write correctly: I can't read you well if you make mistakes.
	2. If a can't understand some noun you can put it with "" or with determinants.
	3. Usually I search synonyms to the words, if you want tu add two concepts that are synonyms you can use the add rule.
	4. If I didn't understand well some sentece, you can undo the actions and try to say me with other sentence or divided.
